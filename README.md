CodeJanitor
===========

Because someone has to clean up this mess
-----------------------------------------

* * *

Welcome to **CodeJanitor**, a collection of scripts designed to make your codebase less of a dumpster fire. If you're reading this, you're probably knee-deep in legacy code, wondering where it all went wrong. Fear not, fellow code warrior, for these tools shall be your mop and bucket in the grand janitorial task of software maintenance.

### What's this all about?

In the immortal words of Larry Wall, we strive to embody the three virtues of a programmer:

1.  **Laziness:** Writing code that's easy to maintain, so we don't have to do it later.
2.  **Impatience:** Creating tools that anticipate and solve problems before they become nightmares.
3.  **Hubris:** Maintaining code so well that even our harshest critics can't find fault.

This repo is a testament to those virtues. It's a collection of scripts in various languages, each designed to perform simple yet crucial tasks in code maintenance. Because let's face it, if we don't clean up our messes, who will?

### What's inside?

*   **PyClutterCutter:** A Python script for identifying and managing unused files. Perfect for those "what the hell does this do?" moments.
*   **RubyRubble:** A Ruby script for finding and managing unused files in Ruby and Rails projects. Because even the most beautiful gems can sometimes lose their sparkle.
*   **CodeMetricsCollector:** A Ruby script that analyzes code complexity, maintainability, and other metrics. It's like having a bored accountant audit your code for fun.
*   _More scripts to come, because the battle against entropy never ends_

### New Features and Improvements

#### CodeMetricsCollector

Introducing the **CodeMetricsCollector**, a powerful Ruby script that collects various code quality metrics from your codebase. It provides insights into code complexity, maintainability, and identifies potential code smells. With snarky commentary and a bored accountant's persona, it makes code analysis slightly more entertaining.

**Features include:**

*   **Dynamic Progress Display:** Real-time metrics display with a visual progress bar.
*   **Snarky Commentary:** Witty and sarcastic remarks to keep you entertained during those long analyses.
*   **Charts and Tables:** ASCII charts to visualize LOC distribution, cyclomatic complexity, and more.
*   **Interrupt Handling:** Gracefully handles interrupts, allowing you to stop the analysis anytime.
*   **Customization:** Configurable thresholds, ignore patterns, and output formats.

#### Configuration File

RubyRubble and CodeMetricsCollector now support a configuration file (`config.yml`) for customizing ignore patterns, file extensions, and other settings. Place this file in the same directory as the script.

#### Dry Run Mode

You can now perform a dry run to see what changes would be made without actually modifying any files. Use the `-d` or `--dry-run` flag when running the scripts.

#### Performance Improvements

RubyRubble and CodeMetricsCollector now use basic multiprocessing for file scanning, improving performance on large codebases.

#### Caching Mechanism

Results are now cached to speed up repeated runs on the same codebase.

#### Unit Tests

Basic unit tests have been added to ensure reliability. Run them using:

    ruby test_ruby_rubble.rb
    ruby test_code_metrics_collector.rb

### TODO List

Here are some suggested improvements and additions for the CodeJanitor project:

1.  **Enhancements:**
    *   Create a simple GUI interface for those who prefer clicking to typing.
    *   Implement logging for better debugging and auditing.
2.  **Additional Single-Purpose Scripts:**
    *   `CommentCleaner`: Remove or update outdated comments.
    *   `DeprecationDetective`: Identify usage of deprecated functions or libraries.
    *   `DuplicateDestroyer`: Find and eliminate duplicate code snippets.
    *   `ComplexityCrusher`: Identify overly complex functions that need refactoring.
3.  **Other Languages to Add:**
    *   JavaScript/TypeScript (for Node.js and frontend projects)
    *   Java
    *   C#
    *   Go
    *   Rust
4.  **Improvements:**
    *   Create a unified command-line interface for all scripts.
    *   Implement a plugin system for easy extension of functionality.
5.  **New Tools:**
    *   `APIVersionManager`: Track and manage API versions across the codebase.
    *   `ConfigurationValidator`: Ensure configuration files are valid and consistent.
    *   `TestCoverageAnalyzer`: Identify areas of the codebase lacking test coverage.
    *   `DependencyGraphGenerator`: Visualize project dependencies and their relationships.
6.  **Reporting:**
    *   Generate comprehensive reports of code health and cleanup progress.
    *   Implement trend analysis to track improvement over time.
7.  **Customization:**
    *   Allow users to define custom rules and patterns for each tool.

### Suggested Developer Utilities

Here are some ideas for simple developer utilities that can help with code management, especially in large organizations:

1.  **CommentCleaner:** Remove or update outdated comments.
2.  **DeprecationDetective:** Identify usage of deprecated functions or libraries.
3.  **DuplicateDestroyer:** Find and eliminate duplicate code snippets.
4.  **ComplexityCrusher:** Identify overly complex functions that need refactoring.
5.  **StyleEnforcer:** Ensure consistent code style across the project.
6.  **DependencyDetective:** Track and manage project dependencies.
7.  **TestCoverageTracker:** Monitor and report on test coverage over time.
8.  **DocuMentor:** Generate and update documentation from code comments.
9.  **VersionVault:** Manage and track API versions across the codebase.
10.  **PerformanceProfiler:** Identify performance bottlenecks in the code.

### Contributing

Found a new way to fight the good fight against code rot? Submit a PR. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Make sure your contributions are:

1.  **Actually useful** (we have enough useless code as it is)
2.  **Well-documented** (future you will thank present you)
3.  **Not overly clever** (we're cleaning up messes, not creating new ones)
4.  **Exclusively AI-generated** (no human-written code allowed)

**Important Note:** All code, documentation, and other repository content must be exclusively AI-generated. There should not be a single line of human-written code in this project. This requirement ensures consistency and maintains the unique nature of this AI-driven initiative.

### A Final Word

Remember, friends: Today's shiny new feature is tomorrow's legacy code. Use these tools wisely, and may your refactoring be ever fruitful.

Now go forth and clean, for the codebase is dark and full of terrors.
