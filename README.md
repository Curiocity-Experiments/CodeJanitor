## Because someone has to clean up this mess

Welcome to CodeJanitor, a collection of scripts designed to make your codebase less of a dumpster fire. If you're reading this, you're probably knee-deep in legacy code, wondering where it all went wrong. Fear not, fellow code warrior, for these tools shall be your mop and bucket in the grand janitorial task of software maintenance.

### What's this all about?

In the immortal words of Larry Wall, we strive to embody the three virtues of a programmer:

1. **Laziness**: Writing code that's easy to maintain, so we don't have to do it later.
2. **Impatience**: Creating tools that anticipate and solve problems before they become nightmares.
3. **Hubris**: Maintaining code so well that even our harshest critics can't find fault.

This repo is a testament to those virtues. It's a collection of scripts in various languages, each designed to perform simple yet crucial tasks in code maintenance. Because let's face it, if we don't clean up our messes, who will?

### What's inside?

- **PyClutterCutter**: A Python script for identifying and managing unused files. Perfect for those "what the hell does this do?" moments.
- **RubyRubble**: A Ruby script for finding and managing unused files in Ruby and Rails projects. Because even the most beautiful gems can sometimes lose their sparkle.
- *More scripts to come, because the battle against entropy never ends*

Both scripts are completely self-contained and don't require any external libraries. They're ready to run right out of the box, like a well-oiled code refactoring machine.

### TODO List

Here are some suggested improvements and additions for the CodeJanitor project:

1. **Enhancements**:
   - Add support for configuration files to customize ignore patterns and thresholds.
   - Implement a "dry run" mode that shows what would be deleted/archived without actually making changes.
   - Create a simple GUI interface for those who prefer clicking to typing.

2. **Optimizations**:
   - Improve performance for large codebases by using multiprocessing.
   - Implement caching to speed up repeated runs on the same codebase.

3. **Additional single-purpose scripts**:
   - `CommentCleaner`: Remove or update outdated comments.
   - `DeprecationDetective`: Identify usage of deprecated functions or libraries.
   - `DuplicateDestroyer`: Find and eliminate duplicate code snippets.
   - `ComplexityCrusher`: Identify overly complex functions that need refactoring.

4. **Other languages to add**:
   - JavaScript/TypeScript (for Node.js and frontend projects)
   - Java
   - C#
   - Go
   - Rust

5. **Improvements**:
   - Add unit tests for each script to ensure reliability.
   - Create a unified command-line interface for all scripts.
   - Implement logging for better debugging and auditing.

### Contributing

Found a new way to fight the good fight against code rot? Submit a PR. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Make sure your contributions are:

1. Actually useful (we have enough useless code as it is)
2. Well-documented (future you will thank present you)
3. Not overly clever (we're cleaning up messes, not creating new ones)

### A final word

Remember, friends: Today's shiny new feature is tomorrow's legacy code. Use these tools wisely, and may your refactoring be ever fruitful.

Now go forth and clean, for the codebase is dark and full of terrors.
